## Contributions

**Front-end development:** Philipus Adriel Tandra and Kimberly Mazel are the main contributors to the frontend development, implementing React and Vite on Login, Register, and Landing pages. The frontend development process gained from the insights and support of every team member. 

**Back-end development:** Alysha Puti Maulidina and Rachel Anastasia Wijaya contributed to developing the server-side logic. In particular, Alysha focuses on handling database and JWT implementations, whilst Rachel worked with OAuth2 and API communication with the front-end.
